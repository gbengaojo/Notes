## Function Dependencies

__Guideline 1__
* Don't mix attributes from distint real-world entities w/i the same relation
  
__Guideline 2__
* Avoid Update Anomalies (Insertion, Deletion, Modification), which can occur if Guideline 1 is violated

__Guideline 3__
* Avoid NULL values

For X -> Y, we say
1) Y is a functional dependancy of X
2) X dictates Y

Formats may include
* {X1, X2,...,Xn} -> Y
* X -> {Y1, Y2,...,Yn}
