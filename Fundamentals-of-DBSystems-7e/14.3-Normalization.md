# 14.3 Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys

>Most practical relational design projects take one of the following two approaches:
>* Perform a conceptual schema design using a conceptual model such as ER or EER and map the conceptual design into a set of relations.
>* Design the relations based on external knowledge derived from an existing implementation of files or forms or reports.

(Codd (1972a))

All normal forms are based on the functional dependencies among attributes (columns) in a relation.

**Normalization** -> Analyzing a relation schema based on its functional dependencies and PKs to achieve:
1) Minimization of redundancies
2) Minization of insertion, update, and deletion anomolies

>  An unsatisfactory relation schema that does not meet the condition for a normal form—the normal form test—is decomposed into smaller relation schemas that contain a subset of the attributes and meet the test
