# 14.3 Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys

>Most practical relational design projects take one of the following two approaches:
>* Perform a conceptual schema design using a conceptual model such as ER or EER and map the conceptual design into a set of relations.
>* Design the relations based on external knowledge derived from an existing implementation of files or forms or reports.

(Codd (1972a))

All normal forms are based on the functional dependencies among attributes (columns) in a relation.

**Normalization** -> Analyzing a relation schema based on its functional dependencies and PKs to achieve:
1) Minimization of redundancies
2) Minization of insertion, update, and deletion anomolies

>  An unsatisfactory relation schema that does not meet the condition for a normal form—the **normal form test** —is decomposed into smaller relation schemas that contain a subset of the attributes and meet the test. Normalization provides:

* A formal framework for analyzing relation schemas based on their keys and on the functional dependencies among their attributes
* A series of normal form tests that can be carried out on individual relation schemas so that the relational database can be normalized to any desired degree

**normal form** -> of a relation refers to the highest normal form condition that it meets, and hence indicates the degree to which it has been normalized.

It is not sufficient for any single relation to be in any normalized form -- rather, the system as a whole should be normalized as best as possible, keeping in mind that:
* The **nonadditive join or lossless join property**, which guarantees that the spurious tuple generation problem discussed in Section 14.1.4 does not occur with respect to the relation schemas created after decomposition
* The **dependency preservation property**, which ensures that each functional dependency is represented in some individual relation resulting after decomposition

> The **nonadditive join property is extremely critical and must be achieved at any cost**, whereas the dependency preservation property, although desirable, is sometimes sacrificed
