Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model
------------------------------------------------------
EER Modeling extends the ideas behind _traditional_ modeling, taking into
consideration more advanced computing technologies that have emerged since the
late 1970s. Concepts such as **artificial intelligence** gave rise to the
**knowledge representation** area of modeling, whereas **software engineering**
gave rise to the **object modeling** area.

Enhanced ER diagrams can be used for computing areas in CAD, telecom, and geo-
graphic information systems.

Such modeling as described above adhere to _semantic data modeling_ concepts, 
rather than traditional ones.

  + Type Inheritance
  + Specialization and Generalization
