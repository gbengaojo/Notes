Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model
------------------------------------------------------
EER Modeling extends the ideas behind _traditional_ modeling, taking into
consideration more advanced computing technologies that have emerged since the
late 1970s. Concepts such as **artificial intelligence** gave rise to the
**knowledge representation** area of modeling, whereas **software engineering**
gave rise to the **object modeling** area.

Enhanced ER diagrams can be used for computing areas in CAD, telecom, and geo-
graphic information systems.

Such modeling as described above adhere to _semantic data modeling_ concepts, 
rather than traditional ones.
  + Class/Sublcass Relationships
  + Type Inheritance
  + Specialization and Generalization
  
## 4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance
The name of an entity type represents 2 things
1) The type of entity itself
2) The set or collection of said entity that exists in the database itself
**type (in context of entity)** -> attributies and relationships
E.g., entity type EMPLOYEE describes thetype of each employee entity, and also
the entire set of EMPLOYEE entities in the database (ambiguous, I know).
+ **subtype (subclass)** -> 

## 4.3 Constraints and Characteristics of Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies
