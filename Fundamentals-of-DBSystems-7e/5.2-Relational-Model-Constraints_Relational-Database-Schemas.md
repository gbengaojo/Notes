5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas
----------------------------------------------------------------

> In a relational database, there will typically be many relations, and the tuples in those relations are usually related in various ways.

+ The state of the entire db depends on the states of *all* its relations at any given point in time
+ **constraints** -> restrictions on the values in a database derived from the rules (requirements) of the mini-world

3 Main Categories of Constraints:
  1) **inherent model-based (implicit) constraints** -> These exist inherently in the data model
    * E.g., a relation cannot have duplicate tuples
    * Discussed more in Section 5.1.2
  2) **schema based (explicit) constraints** -> Restrictions that can be directly expressed in the schema of the data model, usually specified by the DDL (SQL)
  3) **application based (semantic) constraints** -> Also called **business rules**
